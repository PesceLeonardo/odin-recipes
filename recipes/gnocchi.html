                Gnocchi (pronounced NYOK-ee) are a varied family of dumplings in Italian cuisine. They are made of small
                rolls of dough, such as those composed of a simple combination of wheat flour, potato, egg, and salt.
                Variations of the dish supplement the simple recipe with flavour additives, such as semolina flour,
                cheese, breadcrumbs, cornmeal or similar ingredients, and possibly including herbs, vegetables, and
                other ingredients. Base ingredients may be substituted with alternatives such as sweet potatoes for
                potatoes or rice flour for wheat flour. Such variations are often considered to be non-traditional.

                Gnocchi are commonly cooked in salted boiling water and then dressed with various sauces. They are
                usually eaten as a first course (primo), but they can also be served as a contorno (side dish) to some
                main courses. Common accompaniments of gnocchi include melted butter with sage, pesto, and various
                sauces.

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Place the potatoes in cold water, then wait for it to boil and let them in the water for 30-40
                    minutes.</li>
                <li>Make a hill of flour and pour the squashed potatoes onto it. The skin will remain in the potato
                    crusher, so there is no need to skin them manually.</li>
                <li>Add the egg, stirred, and some salt.</li>
                <li>Work on the dough, but don't let it get too tough.</li>
                <li>Take some dough and, with your fingers, gently make a roll.</li>
                <li>Cut the roll with a knife and use a fork to give them the typical look.</li>
                <li>Now you can just cook them in salted boiling water, and they're ready!</li>
