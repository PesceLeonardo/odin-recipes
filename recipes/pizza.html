                Pizza is an Italian dish typically consisting of a flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with
                tomato sauce cheese, and other ingredients, baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired
                oven.
                <br>
                <br>
                The term pizza was first recorded in 997 AD, in a Latin manuscript from the southern Italian town of
                Gaeta, in Lazio, on the border with Campania. Raffaele Esposito is often credited for creating the
                modern pizza in Naples. In 2009, Neapolitan pizza was registered with the European Union as a
                traditional speciality guaranteed (TSG) dish. In 2017, the art of making Neapolitan pizza was included
                on UNESCO's list of intangible cultural heritage.
                <br>
                <br>
                Pizza and its variants are among the most popular foods in the world. Pizza is sold at a variety of
                restaurants, including pizzerias (pizza specialty restaurants), Mediterranean restaurants, via delivery,
                and as street food. In Italy, pizza served in a restaurant is presented unsliced, and is eaten with the
                use of a knife and fork. In casual settings, however, it is typically cut into slices to be eaten while
                held in the hand. Pizza is also sold in grocery stores in a variety of forms, including frozen or as
                kits for self-assembly. Store-bought pizzas are then cooked using a home oven.

                <li>
                    <h4>Proof the Yeast</h4>

                        <li>Pour 175ml warm water into a large mixing bowl.</li>
                        <li>Sprinkle 2¼ teaspoons (7g) active dry yeast over the water.</li>
                        <li>Let it sit for 5 minutes until dissolved and foamy. Stir if needed.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Make and Knead the Dough</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Add the following ingredients to the bowl:
                            <ul>
                                <li>250g all-purpose flour</li>

                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Mix on low speed using a stand mixer with a paddle attachment for 1 minute.</li>
                        <li>
                            Switch to the dough hook and knead for 7–10 minutes on low-medium speed.<br>
                            (If kneading by hand, mix and knead until smooth and slightly sticky.)
                        </li>
                        <li>If the dough is too wet, add a little more flour.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h4>Let the Dough Rise</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Lightly oil a large bowl with 1 teaspoon olive oil.</li>
                        <li>Place the dough in the bowl, turning it to coat with oil.</li>
                        <li>
                            Cover with plastic wrap and let it rise:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Fast Rise: 1.5 hours in a warm place (24–29°C).</li>
                                <li>Medium Rise: 8 hours at room temperature.</li>
                                <li>Slow Rise: 24 hours in the fridge (for better flavor).</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h4>Preheat the Oven and Pizza Stone</h4>

                        <li>
                            On a lightly floured surface, flatten one ball into a 25–30cm circle:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Press the center and stretch outward.</li>
                                <li>Let it rest 5 minutes if it resists stretching.</li>
                                <li>Gently pull and rotate until desired size is reached.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h4>Prepare the Dough for Toppings</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Press small dents into the dough to prevent bubbling.</li>
                        <li>Brush the top with olive oil to avoid sogginess.</li>
                        <li>Let it rest for 10–15 minutes.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h4>Transfer to Pizza Peel</h4>

                        <li>Place the stretched dough on top.</li>
                        <li>Reshape if necessary.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h4>Add Toppings</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Spread 80ml tomato sauce evenly over the dough.</li>
                        <li>Sprinkle with 80g shredded cheese.</li>
                        <li>Add toppings sparingly to avoid a soggy crust.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h4>Bake the Pizza</h4>
                    <ol>

                        <li>Slide the pizza onto the stone.</li>

                                <li>The crust is golden brown.</li>
                                <li>The cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>(Optional) Add more cheese in the last 2 minutes of baking.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
