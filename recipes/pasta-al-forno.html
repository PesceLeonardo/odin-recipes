                Pasta al forno (lit. "pasta to the oven", i.e. "baked pasta") or timballo di pasta is a typical dish of
                Italian cuisine,
                made of (usually short) pasta covered with béchamel sauce, tomato sauce and cheese, and cooked in the
                oven.
                <br>
                <br>
                Baked pasta can ideally be divided in two big categories:<br>
                the version with béchamel sauce was born in the Renaissance courts of the <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Italy" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer">center</a> and
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Italy" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer">north</a>, as a poorer
                variant of meat pies, from which probably derive very famous dishes such as
                <a href="./lasagna.html">lasagne al forno</a> and Emilian cannelloni;<br>
                the so-called pasta 'nfurnata or pasta 'ncasciata is instead one of the most typical dishes of Sicily
                (particularly of the province of Messina, in the specific of Mistretta, and of the province of
                Catania) and has its origins in very ancient traditions, essentially ascribable to the sumptuous
                timbales that Arabs
                introduced in Sicily during their domination dating back to the ninth century, to which, however, is due
                the name
                timballo itself.
