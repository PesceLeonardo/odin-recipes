        <section>
            <p>
                Tagliatelle (pronounced tah-llya-TEHL-leh from the Italian word tagliare, meaning "to cut") are a
                traditional type of pasta
                from the Italian regions of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emilia-Romagna" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer">Emilia-Romagna</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marche"
                    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marche</a>.<br>
                Individual pieces of tagliatelle are long, flat ribbons that are similar in shape to fettuccine and are
                traditionally about 6 mm (¼ in) wide.<br>
                Tagliatelle can be served with a variety of sauces, though the classic is a meat sauce or Bolognese
                sauce.
                <br>
                <br>
                Tagliatelle are traditionally made with egg pasta. The traditional ratio is one egg to one hundred grams
                of flour.
                <br>
                <br>
                More than tagliatelle, Odin Recipes will teach you how to make egg pasta, so that you may decide what
                kind of pasta you want to make. We will, however, add a typical tagliatelle at the end.
                <br>
                <br>
                Enjoy!

            <ul>
                <li>1 egg</li>
                <li>100g of flour 00</li>
                <li>½ tbsp of extra-virgin olive oil</li>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Pour the flour on the work surface, making a mound. Leave aside 20-30g in case the dough gets too
                    tough.</li>
                <li>From the mound, make a well and add the egg/s, salt, and oil.</li>
                <li>With a fork, stir the egg/s and slowly make the flour absorb them. Don't worry if they spill a bit,
                    it's okay!</li>
                <li>When the dough gets tough, start kneading it by hand. The dough should be quite hard, you should be
                    able to feel the effort. We recommend kneading it for 5-6 minutes.</li>
                <li>Now, place a thin plastic paper on the dough and let it rest for 20-30 minutes.</li>
                <li>After it has rested, it should have got softer. Take your rolling pin and spread the dough on your
                    work surface. If it sticks, add some flour. Continue until it's really thin.</li>
                <li>Cover the now spread dough with a kitchen towel and let it rest for 10 minutes.<br>
                    <aside>NOTE: If you're making ravioli or stuffed pasta, you can skip this step.</aside>
                </li>
                <li>Roll the dough from one side to about half, then do the same from the opposite side. Now, with a
                    sharp knife, start cutting the tagliatelle with a width of about ½ cm.</li>
                <li>The tagliatelle are ready!</li>

                <li>75g of ground beef</li>
                <li>75g of tomato purée</li>
                <li>50g of beef broth</li>
                <li>40g of pancetta</li>
                <li>15g of carrot</li>
                <li>15g of celery</li>
                <li>7g of onion</li>
                <li>Red wine (or dry white wine)</li>
                <li>Milk</li>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finely chop the pancetta. Clean the celery, carrot, and onion, then chop them as well</li>
                <li>In a saucepan, sauté the pancetta with some olive oil. Add the vegetables and let them
                    soften gently. Add the ground beef and brown it for about 5 minutes. Deglaze with ½ glass of wine
                    and let it fully evaporate.</li>
                <li>Add the tomato purée and stir for a couple of minutes. Then, pour in ½ glass of milk and cover with
                    the broth. Let the
                    ragù simmer for 2–3 hours, occasionally adding more broth and adjusting with salt and pepper as
                    needed</li>
                <li>Boil the tagliatelle in salted boiling water for 3–4 minutes, then drain and toss with plenty of
                    ragù. The <strong>Tagliatelle alla Bolognese</strong> are ready!</li>
