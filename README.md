# odin-recipes

Description:
The first TOP project, a small website with a basic homepage and many webpages with different recipes.

Skills:
With this project, I will showcase the skills acquired through TOP's fundamental HTML course,
building a basic layout and placing information (through text, images, and links) on the page.

End of the project:
Although the project was supposed to showcase the fundamentals of HTML I had acquired,
having taken a fundamental CSS course I decided to try experimenting with CSS as well.
It is very rudimentary, but with this being my first project I am proud of it.
Given my limited knowledge, I had to get creative to achieve the look I wanted.
This project taught me many things about web development that I am sure will come in handy in the future.
